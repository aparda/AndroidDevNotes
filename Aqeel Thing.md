### **1. What is the Rationalist Ideal, and how does it relate to religion and science?**

**Question:** Define the rationalist ideal and explain its connection to the relationship between religion and science.  
**Answer:** The rationalist ideal is the belief that all truths, both moral and natural, can be understood through pure reason. This perspective often leads to the assumption that science and religion are in conflict. However, thinkers like Tony Jack argue that the brain operates in dual domains—analytic (reasoning) and empathic (social-emotional insight). Religion often activates the empathic network, enabling moral and emotional insights, while science relies more on the analytic network. This suggests that science and religion address different aspects of human understanding rather than inherently contradicting each other.

### **2. What is dual-process theory, and how does it apply to faith?**

**Question:** Describe dual-process theory and its implications for spiritual belief.  
**Answer:** Dual-process theory explains that humans have two competing modes of thinking: intuitive (fast, emotional) and analytical (slow, logical). Neuroscience indicates that when engaging with faith and the supernatural, the analytic network of the brain is subdued, allowing the empathic network to dominate. This shift fosters social, emotional, and moral insights that transcend purely material or scientific understanding.

### **3. What is the significance of physical constants in the fine-tuning argument for the existence of God?**

**Question:** How do physical constants support the idea of fine-tuning, and why do some scientists see this as evidence of a creator?  
**Answer:** Physical constants, such as the gravitational force and electromagnetic strength, are precisely balanced to allow for the existence of life and the universe as we know it. For example, slight variations in these constants would render the universe uninhabitable. This fine-tuning leads many scientists to hypothesize that the universe was designed with life in mind, as it is statistically improbable for such precise conditions to arise by chance alone.

### **4. How does the concept of "absolute justice" provide a perspective on the coexistence of evil and a divine plan?**

**Question:** Explain the concept of "absolute justice" and its role in addressing the problem of evil.  
**Answer:** Absolute justice is the idea that every individual ultimately receives what they deserve based on their actions—reward for good and punishment for evil. This concept suggests that the presence of evil and suffering in the world is a necessary condition for freedom and personal growth. It posits that adversity fosters individuality, culture, and moral character, and that ultimate accountability ensures fairness in the grand scheme.

### **5. How do William Clifford and William James differ in their views on belief without evidence?**

**Question:** Compare and contrast Clifford’s and James’s approaches to belief without sufficient evidence.  
**Answer:** William Clifford maintained that it is always morally wrong to believe anything without sufficient evidence, emphasizing the societal dangers of credulity and unverified beliefs. In contrast, William James argued in _The Will to Believe_ that certain beliefs are justified without evidence if they involve genuine, live, forced, and momentous decisions. James highlighted that taking risks in belief can be necessary to access some truths, especially in cases where evidence is unavailable or undecidable.

---

### **6. What does the Principle of Charity advocate in arguments?**

**Question:** What is the Principle of Charity, and how should it guide discussions?  
**Answer:** The Principle of Charity, derived from the Greek word _Caritas_ (love or care), encourages individuals to interpret others' arguments in the most reasonable and positive light. This approach fosters understanding and constructive dialogue, avoiding misrepresentation or unnecessary conflict.

---

### **7. How do the principles of noncontradiction and double-truth address conflicts between religion and science?**

**Question:** Explain the principles of noncontradiction and double-truth in the context of religion and science.  
**Answer:** The Principle of Noncontradiction states that something cannot be both true and false simultaneously. In contrast, the double-truth perspective allows for the coexistence of contradictory truths from religion and philosophy, recognizing that each may offer valid insights in its respective domain without undermining the other.

---

### **8. Why does James emphasize the importance of taking risks in forming beliefs?**

**Question:** According to William James, why is it sometimes necessary to take risks in forming beliefs?  
**Answer:** James argues that avoiding falsehood entirely may prevent individuals from discovering important truths. He believes that some truths can only be accessed through decisions made without complete evidence, especially in cases of genuine options—decisions that are live, forced, and momentous.

# PG 5-10
### **William James: The Will to Believe**

**Q1: What role does William James assign to our 'passional nature' in guiding beliefs?**  
**A1:** James argues that our "passional nature" (emotions, desires, and instincts) has a legitimate role in decision-making when evidence is insufficient. In such cases, waiting for evidence may hinder personal or moral growth.

**Q2: What are 'live,' 'forced,' and 'momentous' options in James’s philosophy?**  
**A2:**

- **Live options:** Choices that are plausible and meaningful to the individual.
- **Forced options:** Decisions where one must choose (avoiding a decision is itself a choice).
- **Momentous options:** Decisions with significant, life-changing consequences.  
    In such situations, James justifies belief without conclusive evidence.

**Q3: How does James justify belief without evidence in religious or moral contexts?**  
**A3:** James adopts a pragmatic justification, suggesting that if a belief, like the existence of God, enhances personal or communal well-being without causing harm, it is permissible even without evidence. He also critiques Clifford's evidentialism for being overly restrictive and impractical in deeply personal matters.

---

### **Blaise Pascal: Pensées and Pascal’s Wager**

**Q1: What is the core argument of Pascal’s Wager?**  
**A1:** Pascal's Wager is a pragmatic argument suggesting it is rational to believe in God. If God exists and you believe, the reward is infinite (eternal salvation). If God does not exist, believing incurs no significant loss. Thus, belief is the safer "bet."

**Q2: How does Pascal address skepticism about his wager?**  
**A2:** Pascal advises skeptics to act as if they believe (e.g., follow religious practices). Over time, this behavior might cultivate genuine belief, emphasizing the pragmatic benefits of faith.

**Q3: How does Pascal view the relationship between reason and faith?**  
**A3:** Pascal asserts that reason alone is insufficient to prove or disprove God's existence. Faith, for Pascal, is a matter of the heart, and belief arises from intuitive understanding rather than rational evidence.

### **Augustine of Hippo: De Genesi ad Litteram**

**Q1: How does Augustine approach the interpretation of Scripture, especially Genesis?**  
**A1:** Augustine emphasizes discerning whether a passage should be interpreted literally or figuratively. He cautions against rigid literalism, especially when it contradicts reason or observable facts, and advocates understanding the author's intent.

**Q2: What is Augustine's stance on the harmony between faith and reason?**  
**A2:** Augustine believes that faith and reason are harmonious because both come from God. Apparent conflicts arise from misunderstandings of either Scripture or scientific knowledge, and he encourages Christians to seek compatibility between the two.

**Q3: Why does Augustine warn against misinterpreting Scripture in ways that contradict reason or science?**  
**A3:** Augustine warns that such misinterpretations risk discrediting Christianity, as non-believers may dismiss the faith when Christians make claims that conflict with observable truths.

**Q4: What advice does Augustine give for interpreting unclear passages in Scripture?**  
**A4:** Augustine advocates humility, advising believers to admit ignorance rather than assert false interpretations. This approach allows for growth in understanding and avoids alienating others.

### **Questions on Al-Ghazali’s _Deliverance from Error_:**

1. **What motivated al-Ghazali's search for certainty in _Deliverance from Error_?**  
    Al-Ghazali was driven by a deep desire for certainty and the realization that much of his previously accepted knowledge was based on imitation (_taqlid_) rather than genuine understanding. He doubted both sense perception and rational thought, leading him into a state of skepticism.
    
2. **Why did al-Ghazali critique philosophers and theologians?**  
    Al-Ghazali critiqued philosophers for relying too heavily on reason and logic while neglecting spiritual and existential truths. He also found theologians’ reliance on dialectical reasoning (_kalam_) insufficient for resolving deeper spiritual doubts, as their arguments were abstract and lacked experiential certainty.
    
3. **What led al-Ghazali to embrace Sufism?**  
    Al-Ghazali turned to Sufism because it offered direct, experiential knowledge of God, which transcended intellectual doubt. Through spiritual practice and purification of the heart, he found the certainty and transformative experience that reason and theological arguments could not provide.
    
4. **What is the concept of _dhawq_ in al-Ghazali’s philosophy?**  
    _Dhawq_ refers to the experiential, inner knowledge of God, akin to “tasting.” Unlike abstract or theoretical knowledge, _dhawq_ is transformative and deeply personal, providing the certainty al-Ghazali sought.
    
5. **How does al-Ghazali view the role of reason in attaining knowledge?**  
    While al-Ghazali values reason, he believes it has limitations in addressing profound spiritual questions. Reason must be subordinated to divine revelation and mystical experience to achieve ultimate certainty and truth.
    
6. **What is the ultimate goal of the Sufi path, according to al-Ghazali?**  
    The ultimate goal is _fana’_ (mystical union with God), in which the self is annihilated, and the seeker experiences God’s presence directly. This state represents the highest form of knowledge and deliverance from error.

### **Questions on Ibn Rushd’s _On the Harmony of Religion and Philosophy_:**

1. **What is the main purpose of Ibn Rushd’s _On the Harmony of Religion and Philosophy_?**  
    Ibn Rushd aims to demonstrate that philosophy and religion are compatible, arguing that both lead to the same truth since they originate from God.
    
2. **How does Ibn Rushd reconcile apparent contradictions between reason and revelation?**  
    Ibn Rushd argues that contradictions arise from misunderstandings of either the scripture or the philosophical argument. He believes that reason and revelation, both being divine in origin, cannot inherently conflict.
    
3. **What is Ibn Rushd’s stance on the interpretation of scripture?**  
    He advocates for allegorical interpretation (_ta’wil_) of scripture, particularly when literal meanings conflict with established philosophical or scientific knowledge. He views scripture as having both literal and deeper meanings.
    
4. **How does Ibn Rushd categorize people based on their capacity to understand religious truths?**  
    Ibn Rushd identifies three groups:
    
    - The **masses**, who rely on literal interpretations.
    - The **theologians** (_mutakallimun_), who use dialectical reasoning.
    - The **philosophers**, who seek deeper truths through demonstrative reasoning.
5. **Why does Ibn Rushd consider the pursuit of philosophy a duty?**  
    He believes that rational investigation of the world is a way to understand God’s creation, which strengthens faith and is a form of worship. He interprets the Qur’an as encouraging such inquiry.
    
6. **What is Ibn Rushd’s response to critics who oppose philosophy?**  
    Ibn Rushd criticizes those who view philosophy as dangerous, arguing that their fears stem from ignorance. He maintains that philosophy strengthens faith and provides a deeper understanding of religious truths.
    
7. **What ethical framework does Ibn Rushd propose for philosophers?**  
    He asserts that philosophers must operate within the bounds of Islamic law (_Shari’a_) and ensure their conclusions align with religious teachings. Philosophy and religion, in his view, both guide individuals toward truth and moral virtue.

### **Comparison Questions:**

1. **How do al-Ghazali and Ibn Rushd differ in their views on the role of reason?**  
    Al-Ghazali emphasizes the limitations of reason, arguing that it must be complemented by revelation and mystical experience to attain certainty. Ibn Rushd, on the other hand, views reason as essential and compatible with revelation, asserting that philosophical inquiry strengthens faith.
    
2. **What is a shared concern of both al-Ghazali and Ibn Rushd regarding religious knowledge?**  
    Both thinkers critique literalism and emphasize the importance of deeper understanding. Al-Ghazali finds this through mystical experience, while Ibn Rushd advocates for allegorical interpretation and rational inquiry.
    
3. **How do their ultimate goals differ?**  
    Al-Ghazali’s goal is mystical union with God (_fana’_), transcending rational understanding. Ibn Rushd’s goal is the harmonious integration of reason and revelation to guide individuals toward truth and virtue.

### **John Hick, "The Philosophy of Religious Pluralism"**

**1. What does Kant’s philosophy of reality suggest about human perception of the world?**

- **Answer:** Kant distinguishes between two realities: the _noumenon_, which is the world in its true, actual form, and the _phenomenon_, which is how we perceive and interpret the world. Our consciousness only interacts with the phenomenon, and not the noumenon directly.

**2. How does Roger Sperry’s Split-Brain Studies relate to John Hick’s philosophy of religious pluralism?**

- **Answer:** Sperry’s studies, which show how each hemisphere of the brain processes the world differently in patients with severed corpus callosum, can be seen as an analogy for Hick’s argument that different religious traditions are various interpretations of the same ultimate reality. Each hemisphere, like each religion, provides a distinct yet valid perspective on reality.

**3. What is the essence of John Hick's pluralistic hypothesis?**

- **Answer:** Hick's pluralistic hypothesis asserts that the world's major religions are distinct responses to the same ultimate reality, referred to as “the Real.” He argues that these religions, though appearing in conflict, are ultimately diverse interpretations of the same transcendent truth.

**4. How does Hick view religious experience?**

- **Answer:** Hick believes that religious experience is interpretive, shaped by cultural and historical contexts. A person from one religious tradition may experience the divine differently from someone in another tradition, but both are encountering the same ultimate reality.

**5. How does Hick explain salvation or liberation across religions?**

- **Answer:** Hick argues that different religions' concepts of salvation (e.g., Christianity's salvation through Christ, Buddhism's enlightenment, or Hinduism’s moksha) all share a common goal: transforming individuals from self-centeredness to alignment with the ultimate reality.

**6. What is Hick’s critique of exclusivism?**

- **Answer:** Hick critiques exclusivism (the idea that only one religion is true and all others are false) for being unjust, as it condemns billions of people who follow different religious paths. Hick believes exclusivism contradicts the notion of a just and loving God.

**7. What does Hick mean by “epistemological humility”?**

- **Answer:** Hick advocates for epistemological humility, which means acknowledging that no single religious tradition can fully comprehend or describe the divine. Each religion provides a limited but valuable perspective on ultimate reality.

**8. How does Hick propose transforming religious identity?**

- **Answer:** Hick suggests that individuals should move beyond a self-centered, exclusivist religious identity and adopt a pluralistic stance, embracing the insights of multiple traditions. This transformation fosters mutual respect and understanding in a diverse, multi-faith world.

**9. What moral and spiritual transformation does Hick emphasize?**

- **Answer:** Hick emphasizes that the true goal of all religions is the transformation of individuals from self-centeredness to a life focused on the divine, marked by love, compassion, and justice. This ethical transformation is more important than doctrinal differences.

### **Jeanine Diller, "Multiple Religious Orientation"**

**1. What is "multiple religious orientation," according to Jeanine Diller?**

- **Answer:** Multiple religious orientation refers to the practice of engaging with and committing to more than one religious tradition simultaneously. Diller challenges the idea that religious commitment must be exclusive to one tradition and advocates for a flexible, multifaceted approach to spirituality.

**2. How does multiple religious orientation allow for metaphysical and epistemic flexibility?**

- **Answer:** Diller suggests that individuals with multiple religious orientations can embrace ideas from different traditions without needing to reconcile them into a single, consistent metaphysical framework. For example, a person might draw from both the Christian concept of God and the Buddhist understanding of no-self.

**3. What ethical benefits does multiple religious orientation offer?**

- **Answer:** Adopting multiple religious orientations allows individuals to cultivate virtues from diverse traditions, such as the compassion of Buddhism and the love emphasized in Christianity. This approach fosters a richer ethical life and greater empathy toward others, including those of different faiths.

**4. What challenges does Diller acknowledge about multiple religious orientation?**

- **Answer:** Diller recognizes the potential for incoherence or superficiality when engaging with multiple traditions. Critics argue that this approach could dilute religious commitment, but Diller counters that one does not need to fully adhere to every doctrine to meaningfully engage with various religious teachings.

**5. How does multiple religious orientation fit into contemporary spiritual practices?**

- **Answer:** Diller connects multiple religious orientation to contemporary trends such as the rise of "spiritual but not religious" identities. In a globalized world, many people are influenced by diverse religious frameworks, and this approach offers a way to authentically engage with multiple traditions.

**6. How can multiple religious orientation lead to spiritual enrichment?**

- **Answer:** By drawing from different traditions, individuals can gain access to a wider range of spiritual practices, teachings, and experiences. This enriches their spiritual life, providing new lenses through which to encounter the divine and deepening their overall religious understanding.

**7. How does Diller's approach to religious pluralism differ from Hick's?**

- **Answer:** While Hick’s pluralism focuses on the idea that all religions are valid paths to the same ultimate reality, Diller’s concept of multiple religious orientation centers on the personal engagement of an individual with multiple traditions. Diller’s framework allows for the simultaneous practice and internal integration of different religious traditions, whereas Hick’s pluralism addresses the coexistence of different traditions in a society.

**8. What implications does multiple religious orientation have for religious identity?**

- **Answer:** Diller challenges the traditional, static notion of religious identity, proposing instead that religious identity can be fluid and dynamic. Individuals can explore and integrate aspects of multiple traditions without feeling the need to choose one, allowing for a more complex, ongoing process of religious exploration.

**9. What does Diller say about religious inclusivity?**

- **Answer:** Diller’s approach promotes inclusivity on a personal level. She suggests that individuals can embrace wisdom from multiple religious traditions without being confined to the boundaries of any single tradition. This fosters a more inclusive, open approach to spirituality.

**Elmer Thiessen, "A Defence of Proselytizing"**

1. **Question**: What is Thiessen’s central argument in defense of proselytizing in “A Defence of Proselytizing”? **Answer**: Thiessen argues that proselytizing, when done ethically, can be an expression of respect for a person’s autonomy and dignity, as it seeks to engage them in a search for truth. He defends the right to proselytize based on the principles of freedom of speech and religion, and he suggests that it can be a moral obligation for believers to share their faith if they believe it is true and beneficial.
    
2. **Question**: What distinguishes evangelism from proselytizing in Thiessen’s view? **Answer**: Thiessen distinguishes evangelism as a broader concept that involves sharing one’s religious beliefs, while proselytizing specifically refers to attempts to convert or persuade others to adopt those beliefs. Proselytizing, in particular, is often seen negatively due to associations with aggressive or unwelcome methods, but Thiessen defends that it can be ethical if done with respect for others’ autonomy.
    
3. **Question**: How does Thiessen address criticisms that proselytizing is coercive or manipulative? **Answer**: Thiessen acknowledges that some forms of proselytizing can be coercive or manipulative, but he argues that these are abuses of proselytizing, not inherent characteristics. He suggests that ethical proselytizing involves respectful dialogue, clarity, and freedom for individuals to make their own decisions without undue pressure or manipulation.
    
4. **Question**: What ethical guidelines does Thiessen propose for proselytizing? **Answer**: Thiessen’s ethical guidelines for proselytizing include respecting the autonomy and dignity of the person being proselytized, avoiding manipulation or coercion, and ensuring the message is truthful and non-threatening. He emphasizes genuine dialogue where both parties are free to express their views and make informed decisions.
    
5. **Question**: How does Thiessen relate the act of proselytizing to moral obligations? **Answer**: Thiessen argues that if one believes their religious convictions are true and beneficial, they have a moral duty to share them with others. He compares this to the obligation of sharing life-saving medical knowledge, suggesting that religious truth, when viewed as life-changing, obligates believers to share it with others.
    
6. **Question**: What does Thiessen mean by the role of truth in proselytizing? **Answer**: Thiessen suggests that proselytizing, when motivated by a sincere belief in the truth of one’s religious convictions, should be viewed as an act of care and concern for others. He believes that it is not an imposition of beliefs but an effort to share what one sees as life-changing truth, grounded in the responsibility to pursue and spread truth.

**Keshav Singh, "Sikh Ethics Sees Self-Centredness As the Source of Human Evil"**

7. **Question**: What is the primary concept of Sikh ethics discussed by Keshav Singh? **Answer**: The primary concept discussed is "haumai," or self-centeredness, which Sikh ethics identifies as the root cause of human evil. Haumai leads to ego, greed, and injustice, disrupting the interconnectedness of life and causing moral corruption. Sikh teachings aim to overcome haumai through selfless service (seva) and by cultivating humility, unity, and equality.
    
8. **Question**: How do Sikhs combat self-centeredness (haumai) according to the article? **Answer**: Sikhs combat haumai by practicing seva (selfless service), which emphasizes humility and serving others. The goal is to overcome ego and align with the divine unity that connects all beings, fostering moral and ethical living.

**Jeannette Armstrong, "En'owkin: What It Means to Be a Sustainable Community"**

9. **Question**: What does the term "En'owkin" refer to in Armstrong’s article? **Answer**: "En'owkin" is a concept from the Okanagan language that represents the process of understanding through gradual integration. It suggests that understanding comes drop by drop, slowly being absorbed into the mind, emphasizing a patient, reflective approach to knowledge.
    
10. **Question**: How does the En'owkin concept influence community decision-making? **Answer**: The En'owkin process promotes collaboration, mutual respect, and interconnectedness in decision-making. It encourages inclusivity, where all voices are heard and the collective wisdom of the community is used to create sustainable, long-term solutions, contrasting with majority-rule approaches that can marginalize minority opinions and create division.
    
11. **Question**: What is the difference between En'owkin and the "Roberts Rules of Democratic Process"? **Answer**: En'owkin contrasts with the "Roberts Rules of Democratic Process" by fostering collaboration rather than majority rule. In En'owkin, all voices are heard and consensus is built, ensuring that minority opinions are given a remedy, which promotes unity and long-term community strength, whereas the majority-rule process often leads to conflict and division.
    
12. **Question**: How does Armstrong describe the relationship between sustainability and community in the En'owkin concept? **Answer**: Armstrong describes sustainability in terms of interconnectedness, where the land, family, and community are viewed as one. En'owkin encourages a holistic approach to sustainability, prioritizing long-term well-being for all and emphasizing the need for collective responsibility to ensure the survival of humanity and the environment.
    
13. **Question**: Why does Armstrong emphasize the importance of rethinking community leadership and practices? **Answer**: Armstrong argues that many communities have been led by profit-driven motives, prioritizing short-term gains over long-term well-being, which has caused the disintegration of original communities. She stresses the importance of rethinking the relationship with the land and focusing on collective creativity and sustainability to ensure the survival and prosperity of all life forms.

### **John Rhodes, "Anabaptist Technology: Lessons from a Communitarian Business"**

**Q1: How do Anabaptist groups like the Amish and Mennonites approach modern technology?**

- **A1:** Anabaptist groups, including the Amish and Mennonites, do not reject all modern technology. Instead, they carefully choose tools that align with their values, such as fostering community, simplicity, and a close relationship with the environment. Their decisions are influenced by spiritual priorities and human connection rather than by convenience or efficiency.

### **Charles Taylor**

**Q2: What does Charles Taylor suggest about human openness to the transcendent in a secular age?**

- **A2:** In a secular age, Charles Taylor highlights that individuals have the possibility to choose whether they remain closed (buffered self) or open (porous self) to the reality of the transcendent.

### **Anselm, Proslogion (excerpts), with replies by Gaunilo and Anselm**

**Q3: What is the difference between a priori and a posteriori knowledge?**

- **A3:** A proposition is knowable a priori if it can be understood independently of experience, while a proposition is knowable a posteriori if it is derived from experience.

**Q4: What is Anselm's ontological argument for the existence of God in the _Proslogion_?**

- **A4:** Anselm argues that God, defined as "that than which nothing greater can be conceived," must exist both in the mind and in reality. Since it is greater to exist in reality than merely as a concept, God must exist in reality.

**Q5: How does Anselm defend God's necessary existence?**

- **A5:** Anselm asserts that God’s existence is not contingent but necessary. While other beings may not exist, God, as the greatest conceivable being, must exist necessarily because a being whose existence is contingent is inferior to one whose existence is necessary.

**Q6: What was Gaunilo's critique of Anselm's ontological argument?**

- **A6:** Gaunilo criticized Anselm’s argument with the analogy of a "perfect island," arguing that just because something can be conceived (like an island) does not mean it must exist. He believed Anselm’s logic could be applied to anything, which would lead to absurd conclusions.

**Q7: How does Anselm respond to Gaunilo's critique?**

- **A7:** Anselm defends his argument by asserting that God is unique because His very essence includes necessary existence. Unlike a perfect island, which could logically not exist, God’s non-existence is impossible, making His existence necessary and not contingent like other concepts.

### **Josh Hochschild, "Tips on Reading the Summa Theologiae of St Thomas Aquinas"**

**Q8: What is the suggested approach to reading _Summa Theologiae_ effectively?**

- **A8:** To read _Summa Theologiae_ effectively, focus on understanding Aquinas’s article structure, which includes objections, a contrary view, the main response (respondeo), and replies to objections. First, read the main response, then examine the objections and replies for context.

---

### **Thomas Aquinas, _Summa Theologiae_ Part I, q. 2: The Existence of God**

**Q9: Why does Aquinas argue that God’s existence is not self-evident?**

- **A9:** Aquinas argues that God’s existence is not self-evident because humans cannot intuitively grasp it without direct experience or evidence. It’s like recognizing someone from a clue, not a clear image.

**Q10: How does Aquinas demonstrate God's existence through effects in the world?**

- **A10:** Aquinas believes God's existence can be demonstrated through observable effects in the world. Just as the wind is known by the movement of leaves, God’s existence is inferred from the design and order of the universe.

**Q11: What are Aquinas’s Five Ways to demonstrate the existence of God?**

- **A11:** Aquinas’s Five Ways include:
    - **Motion:** There must be a First Mover that causes movement without being moved itself, identified as God.
    - **Cause:** There must be an uncaused cause, or God, that initiates the chain of events.
    - **Contingency:** A necessary being (God) must exist to explain contingent beings that could not have existed.
    - **Gradation:** Observing qualities like goodness in degrees implies a maximal source, which is God.
    - **Order/Design:** The order in nature implies a designer, which Aquinas identifies as God.

### **David Hume, _Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion_ (excerpt)**

**Q12: What does Philo argue about human suffering and superstition?**

- **A12:** Philo argues that while humans overcome physical threats, they create "imaginary enemies" through superstition, which adds to life’s anxieties. He also points out that society introduces new threats like conflict and oppression.

**Q13: What is Demea's view on internal and external suffering?**

- **A13:** Demea believes that while external threats like illness or violence are vast, internal struggles such as disease and despair are even more tormenting. He emphasizes the universal human experience of sorrow, labor, and lack of fulfillment.

**Q14: How does Philo challenge Cleanthes’s belief in a benevolent deity?**

- **A14:** Philo questions how a benevolent deity could allow widespread suffering. He poses the Epicurean dilemma: if God is willing but unable to prevent evil, He is powerless; if able but unwilling, He is malevolent; if both willing and able, why does evil exist?

---

### **Paul Tidman, "Plantinga's Free Will Defense"**

**Q15: What is the logical problem of evil, and how does Plantinga address it?**

- **A15:** The logical problem of evil argues that the existence of evil is incompatible with an all-powerful, all-good God. Plantinga addresses this by proposing that free will allows for the possibility of evil, and that a world with free will is more valuable than one without.

**Q16: What is "transworld depravity" in Plantinga's Free Will Defense?**

- **A16:** "Transworld depravity" suggests that in every possible world where free creatures exist, there would always be some instances of those creatures choosing evil. This explains why God, even with omnipotence, cannot create a world with free will but no evil.

**Q17: What conclusion does Plantinga draw about the coexistence of God and evil?**

- **A17:** Plantinga argues that the existence of evil does not logically contradict the existence of a wholly good and omnipotent God. The presence of evil is logically compatible with God’s existence if God values the free will of His creatures.

### Questions and Answers

#### 1. **What are Near-Death Experiences (NDEs) and Out-of-Body Experiences (OBEs), according to Dr. Susan Blackmore?**

- **Answer**: NDEs often involve OBEs, where individuals feel as though they have left their physical bodies. These experiences are subjective and involve vivid sensations but do not provide definitive evidence that anything physically leaves the body. Dr. Blackmore argues that NDEs are psychological phenomena rather than proof of an afterlife.

#### 2. **What is Dr. Susan Blackmore’s stance on the evidence for life after death based on NDEs and OBEs?**

- **Answer**: Dr. Blackmore asserts that NDEs and OBEs do not offer evidence for the survival of consciousness after death. She points out that experiments attempting to verify out-of-body perceptions have yielded inconclusive results, and there is no consistent evidence supporting the notion of a separate "soul" or entity that leaves the body.

#### 3. **What are some of the psychological and neurological explanations for NDEs and OBEs that Dr. Blackmore supports?**

- **Answer**: Dr. Blackmore suggests that NDEs and OBEs may arise from brain activity, imagination, and memory during altered states of consciousness. She believes these experiences are influenced by neurological and psychological processes rather than being spiritual or supernatural events.

#### 4. **What challenge does Dr. Blackmore present in terms of proving OBEs as physical or spiritual events?**

- **Answer**: Dr. Blackmore highlights theoretical issues, such as how an "astral body" could interact with the physical world, making it difficult to substantiate claims of OBEs as physical or spiritual occurrences. This adds complexity to proving that anything physically leaves the body during such experiences.

#### 5. **How does Dr. Blackmore approach the scientific study of NDEs and OBEs?**

- **Answer**: Dr. Blackmore emphasizes the need for a scientific approach to studying NDEs and OBEs while respecting the profound impact these experiences can have on individuals. She advocates for separating subjective experiences from their interpretations and focusing on neurological and psychological explanations.

#### 6. **What does Travis Dumsday mean by "counter-cultural religious experiences"?**

- **Answer**: Counter-cultural religious experiences are those that challenge societal norms and dominant cultural paradigms. These experiences often emerge in opposition to mainstream ideologies or practices and can include the experiences of mystics, reformers, or prophets who disrupt established religious or social frameworks.

#### 7. **What epistemic value do counter-cultural religious experiences hold, according to Dumsday?**

- **Answer**: Dumsday suggests that counter-cultural religious experiences offer unique epistemic value, providing insights into religious truth and the human quest for meaning. The transformative nature of such experiences, especially when they challenge societal norms, can lend credibility to the authenticity of religious claims.

#### 8. **How do counter-cultural religious experiences contribute to personal transformation, according to Dumsday?**

- **Answer**: Counter-cultural religious experiences often result in profound personal transformation, such as moral and spiritual renewal. Dumsday argues that these lasting transformations distinguish counter-cultural experiences from mere psychological anomalies, strengthening their evidential weight in understanding religious truth.

#### 9. **What critique do counter-cultural religious experiences offer against mainstream religiosity?**

- **Answer**: Counter-cultural religious experiences frequently critique institutionalized religion and challenge religious adherents who align too closely with societal power structures. Dumsday suggests that such experiences can reinvigorate religious traditions by addressing spiritual stagnation and moral compromise within established religious institutions.

#### 10. **What are the philosophical challenges related to counter-cultural religious experiences?**

- **Answer**: One challenge is distinguishing genuine counter-cultural religious experiences from delusions or fanaticism. Dumsday responds to this challenge by emphasizing the importance of coherence, transformative impact, and alignment with broader ethical or metaphysical truths as criteria for evaluating their authenticity.

#### 11. **How do counter-cultural religious experiences contribute to religious diversity, according to Dumsday?**

- **Answer**: Counter-cultural religious experiences often give rise to religious innovation, schisms, and the formation of new spiritual movements. They highlight the dynamic nature of religious belief across history and cultures, contributing to the evolution of religious traditions and the diversity of religious expressions.

#### 12. **What is the central argument of Dumsday’s article on counter-cultural religious experiences?**

- **Answer**: Dumsday argues that counter-cultural religious experiences are epistemically significant because they challenge societal norms, critique institutionalized religion, and inspire profound personal transformation. These experiences contribute to the evolution of religious traditions, and their lasting impact provides evidence of their authenticity.

Here’s a review of the key terminology and concepts provided, structured into questions and answers to help with your exam preparation:

### **Part I - Term Identification (20 Marks)**

**1. Clifford's Maxim**

- **Q:** What is Clifford's Maxim, and why is it significant?
- **A:** Clifford's Maxim states that "It is wrong always, everywhere, and for anyone, to believe anything upon insufficient evidence." It emphasizes the moral responsibility of having beliefs grounded in evidence, and its significance lies in its argument against irrational or unsupported belief systems, which can perpetuate falsehoods.

**2. Pascal's Wager**

- **Q:** What is Pascal's Wager, and how does it use the concept of expected value?
- **A:** Pascal's Wager posits that believing in God is the rational choice because the potential reward (eternal salvation) vastly outweighs the potential loss (finite suffering). The expected value is used to show that the potential benefits of belief are so much greater than the possible consequences of disbelief that it is rational to believe without evidence.

**3. Genuine Options (William James)**

- **Q:** What are "genuine options" according to William James, and how do they relate to belief?
- **A:** Genuine options are choices that are live, forced, and momentous. James argues that in the case of genuine options, it is permissible to believe without sufficient evidence because they present a situation where choosing to believe has significant consequences, and the belief is inevitable and impactful.

**4. Polyfideism (John Hick)**

- **Q:** What is "polyfideism" and how does it relate to religious pluralism?
- **A:** Polyfideism, a concept introduced by John Hick, asserts that all religions lead to the same ultimate truth, though through different paths. This view challenges the notion of one true religion, suggesting that diverse religious traditions are equally valid in their pursuit of the divine.

**5. Buffered vs Porous Self (Charles Taylor)**

- **Q:** What is the difference between the buffered and porous self according to Charles Taylor?
- **A:** The buffered self is characterized by a sense of being closed off from the world, where individuals see themselves as autonomous and separate from external influences. The porous self, in contrast, is open to the world and more attuned to transcendence or spiritual influences.

**6. Gaunilo’s Lost Island Argument**

- **Q:** What is Gaunilo’s Lost Island Argument, and how does it challenge Anselm’s Ontological Argument?
- **A:** Gaunilo’s Lost Island Argument challenges Anselm's Ontological Argument by claiming that just because we can conceive of the greatest possible island (like Anselm’s greatest conceivable being), it does not necessarily mean it exists. Gaunilo used this analogy to show that Anselm’s reasoning could lead to absurd conclusions.

**7. Alvin Plantinga’s Free Will Defense**

- **Q:** What is Alvin Plantinga’s Free Will Defense?
- **A:** Plantinga’s Free Will Defense argues that the existence of evil does not contradict the existence of an omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent God because evil is a consequence of human free will. For genuine moral good to exist, humans must have the freedom to choose, and this freedom allows for the possibility of evil.

**8. Virtue Soul-Making Theodicy**

- **Q:** What is the Virtue Soul-Making Theodicy?
- **A:** The Virtue Soul-Making Theodicy, associated with John Hick, suggests that suffering and evil are necessary for the development of virtues such as courage, patience, and compassion. This process of "soul-making" enables individuals to grow morally and spiritually.

**9. Counter-Cultural Religious Experience (Travis Dumsday)**

- **Q:** What does Travis Dumsday mean by "Counter-Cultural Religious Experience"?
- **A:** Dumsday describes counter-cultural religious experiences as those that challenge societal norms and expectations. These experiences can be transformative and provide epistemic value by offering new perspectives on religious truth, often inspiring social or personal change.

**10. Principle of Noncontradiction (Ibn Rushd)**

- **Q:** What is the Principle of Noncontradiction, and how did Ibn Rushd use it?
- **A:** The Principle of Noncontradiction asserts that contradictory propositions cannot both be true at the same time. Ibn Rushd used this principle to argue that religion and philosophy can coexist as long as religious texts do not contradict established scientific truths.

### **Part II - Short Answer (20 Marks)**

**1. What is the difference between a priori and a posteriori knowledge? How do these concepts relate to Anselm's and Aquinas's arguments for God's existence?**

- **A:** A priori knowledge is knowledge gained through reasoning or logic alone, independent of experience, while a posteriori knowledge is based on sensory experience or empirical evidence. Anselm's Ontological Argument for God’s existence is a priori, asserting that God must exist because we can conceive of Him as the greatest possible being. Aquinas, in contrast, presents a posteriori arguments, such as the Argument from Motion, that rely on empirical observations of the world.

**2. Explain William Clifford’s reasoning in The Ethics of Belief. Why does he consider belief without sufficient evidence unethical?**

- **A:** William Clifford argues that it is morally wrong to hold beliefs without sufficient evidence because doing so can lead to harmful consequences for others and society. In his shipowner anecdote, Clifford illustrates how believing in the ship’s seaworthiness without evidence results in the loss of lives, emphasizing the social responsibility of belief.

**3. How does Blaise Pascal’s Wager utilize the concept of expected value? Why is it significant in discussions of religious belief?**

- **A:** Pascal’s Wager uses expected value to argue that believing in God is the rational choice because the potential reward (eternal life) vastly outweighs the potential cost (finite suffering). This argument focuses on the practical consequences of belief, suggesting that belief in God is a risk-free bet with potentially infinite gains.

**4. Compare and contrast Al-Ghazali’s and Ibn Rushd’s views on the harmony of reason and revelation.**

- **A:** Al-Ghazali believed that reason alone could not lead to truth and that divine revelation was necessary for certainty. In contrast, Ibn Rushd argued that reason and revelation could coexist, as long as religious teachings did not contradict known scientific truths. Rushd’s principle of noncontradiction allowed for a synthesis of philosophy and religion.

### **Part III - Long Answer (10 Marks)**

**1. Discuss two approaches to theodicy: Plantinga’s Free Will Defense and Marilyn McCord Adams’s reflections on horrendous evils. How do these approaches address the challenge of evil, and which do you find more compelling?**

- **A:** Plantinga’s Free Will Defense argues that evil is a necessary consequence of human free will, and for moral goodness to be meaningful, individuals must have the freedom to choose. This addresses the problem of evil by asserting that God cannot create a world where free will exists without allowing for the possibility of evil. Marilyn McCord Adams, on the other hand, focuses on horrendous evils, such as genocide or extreme suffering, arguing that these evils are incomprehensible without a powerful and loving God to transform them. She suggests that only a divine being can bring good from such evils. The compelling nature of these approaches depends on one's view of free will versus divine intervention, but both address the challenge of evil by either justifying it or focusing on how it can be redeemed.
