# Navigate Between Screens with Compose
## Define Routes and Create a NavHostController
### Parts of the Navigation Component
The Navigation component has 3 main parts:
- **NavController**: Responsible for navigating between destinations - aka screens of app.
- **NavGraph**: Maps composable destinations to navigate to.
- **NavHost**: Composable acting as a container for displaying the current destination of the NavGraph.

### Define Routes for Destinations in App
- Route: String that corresponds to a destination, serves as a unique identifier. Similar to URL for website. Destination is typically a single composable or group of composables corresponding to what the user sees.
- The route of an app can be defined using an enum. Enum classes in Kotlin have a name property that returns a string with the property name.
- The routes of the cupcake app:
	- `Start`: Select quantity of cupcakes from one of three buttons.
	- `Flavor`: Select flavour from list of choices.
	- `Pickup`: Select pickup date from list of choices.
	- `Summary`: Review selection and either send or cancel order.
### Add a NavHost to App
- `NavHost` is a Composable that displays other composable destinations, based on given route. E.g. if route `Flavor`, then `NavHose` would show the screen to choose cupcake flavour.
- Syntax:
![fae7688d6dd53de9.png|300](https://developer.android.com/static/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-navigation/img/fae7688d6dd53de9.png?authuser=1)
- Notable Parameters:
	- `navContoller`: Instance of `NavHostController` class. Use object to navigate between screen, e.g. call `navigate()` method to navigate to another destination. Can obtain `NavHostController()` by calling `rememberNavController()` from a composable function.
	- `startDestination`: String route defining the destination shown by default when app first displays `NavHost`. In this case, `Start`.
	- `NavHost` also takes `modifier` parameter.
```kotlin
fun CupcakeApp(
	viewModel: OrderViewModel = viewModel(),
	navController: NavHostController = rememberNavController()
){
	Scaffold(  
	    ...
	    }  
	) { innerPadding ->  
	    val uiState by viewModel.uiState.collectAsState()  
	  
	    NavHost(  
	        navController = navController, 
	        startDestination = CupcakeScreen.Start.name,  
	        modifier = Modifier.padding(innerPadding)  
	    ) {  
	        
	    }
	}
}
```

### Handle Routes in `NavHost`
`NavHost` takes a function type for its content.
![f67974b7fb3f0377.png|300](https://developer.android.com/static/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-navigation/img/f67974b7fb3f0377.png?authuser=1)
Within the content function of `NavHost`, call `composable()` function. `composable()` has 2 required parameters:
- `route`: String corresponding to name of route. Can be any unique string. Use name property of `CupcakeScreen` Enum's constants.
- `content`: Can call composable you want to display for given route.
Can call `composable()` once for each of the four routes.
**NOTE**: The `composable()` function is an extension function of [`NavGraphBuilder`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/navigation/NavGraphBuilder?authuser=1).

1. Call `composable` and add the new screen:
```kotlin
NavHost(  
    navController = navController,  
    startDestination = CupcakeScreen.Start.name,  
    modifier = Modifier.padding(innerPadding)  
) {  
    composable(route = CupcakeScreen.Start.name) {  
        StartOrderScreen(  
            quantityOptions = DataSource.quantityOptions,  
            modifier = Modifier  
                .fillMaxSize()  
                .padding(dimensionResource(R.dimen.padding_medium))  
        )  
    }  
}
```

2. Under the `composable` add a new `composable()`. In the trailing lamda, get a reference to `LocalContext.current` and store it in a variable. `Context` is an abstract class whose implementation is provided by the Android system. It allows access to application-specific resources and classes, as well as upcalls for application-level operations such as launching activities, etc. Can use this variable to get strings from the list of resource IDs to view model to display the list of flavours.
```kotlin
import androidx.compose.ui.platform.LocalContext
composable(route = CupcakeScreen.Flavor.name) {  
    val context = LocalContext.current  
}
```

3. Add  `SelectOptionScreen()`. To get the list of flavours from the app strings resource, transform the list of resource IDs into a list of strings using the `map()` function, and calling `context.resources.getString(id)` for each flavour.
```kotlin
composable(route = CupcakeScreen.Flavor.name) {  
    val context = LocalContext.current  
    SelectOptionScreen(  
        subtotal = uiState.price,  
        options = DataSource.flavors.map {  
            id -> context.resources.getString(id)  
        }
          
    )  
}
```

4. Fill in the rest of the sections
```kotlin
composable(route = CupcakeScreen.Pickup.name) {  
    SelectOptionScreen(  
        subtotal = uiState.price,  
        options = uiState.pickupOptions,  
        onSelectionChanged = { viewModel.setDate(it) },  
        modifier = Modifier.fillMaxHeight()  
    )  
}  
  
composable(route = CupcakeScreen.Summary.name) {  
    OrderSummaryScreen(  
        orderUiState = uiState,  
        modifier = Modifier.fillMaxHeight()  
    )  
}
```
In this section, we map the defined routes to composables in a `NavHost`. 
## Navigate Between Routes
- In this section, we use `NavHostController` to navigate between screens.
- The `navController` property from calling `rememberNavController` is responsible for navigating between routes. Property is defined in the `CupcakeApp` composable, now need to access it from different screens in app. 
- We pass `NavHost` to handle the app's navigation so that navigation logic is kept separate from individual UI. 
- As a general rule, it is strongly recommended to construct the nav controller by instantiating a [`NavHostController`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/navigation/NavHostController), which offers additional APIs specifically for a NavHost. The NavHostController should still only be externally accessible as a [`NavController`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/navigation/NavController), rather than directly exposing it as a [`NavHostController`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/navigation/NavHostController).
### Add Button Handlers to `StartOrderScreen`
Will start with adding a function type parameter called when one of the quantity buttons is pressed on the first screen. Function is passed into `StartOrderScreen` composable, responsible for updating `ViewModel` and navigating to next screen.

```kotlin
fun StartOrderScreen(  
    quantityOptions: List<Pair<Int, Int>>,  
    onNextButtonClicked: (Int) -> Unit,  
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier  
) {
```
Did the above for each of the other pages.

### Navigate to Another Route
To navigate to another route, just need to call the `navigate()` method on your instance of `NavHostController`. ![fc8aae3911a6a25d.png|200](https://developer.android.com/static/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-navigation/img/fc8aae3911a6a25d.png?authuser=1)

In  `CupcakeScreen.kt`, in `CupcakeApp`, navigate to each composable and add the required callback including where each button should navigate.

```kotlin
composable(route = CupcakeScreen.Start.name) {  
    StartOrderScreen(  
        quantityOptions = DataSource.quantityOptions,  
        onNextButtonClicked = {  
            viewModel.setQuantity(it)  
            navController.navigate(CupcakeScreen.Flavor.name)  
        },  
        modifier = Modifier  
            .fillMaxSize()  
            .padding(dimensionResource(R.dimen.padding_medium))  
    )  
}
```

- When `navigate()` is called, the screen changes and is placed on top of the back stack. Thus, when you press the system back button, you can navigate to the previous page.
- The app stacks each screen on top of the previous one, and the back button removes them. History of screens from `startDestination` at the button to the topmost screen is known as the *back stack*.

### Pop to the Start Screen.
The **Cancel** button should pop--remove--all screens from the back stack, returning to the starting screen. To do that: ![2f382e5eb319b4b8.png|300](https://developer.android.com/static/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-navigation/img/2f382e5eb319b4b8.png?authuser=1)

The `popBackStack()` method requires 2 parameters:
- `route`: String representing the route of the destination you want to navigate back to.
- `inclusive`: Boolean. If true, also pops (removes) specified route. If false, `popBackStack()` will remove all destinations on top of - but not including - the start destination, leaving it as the topmost screen visible to the user.
## Navigate to Another App
The Cupcake app as part of the *Send Order to Another App* uses the share screen to send the order to another app using the [ShareSheet](https://developer.android.com/training/sharing/send?authuser=1) used to show the sharing options. This is provided by the Android OS, which is not called by `navController`. Instead, you use something called *Intent*.

[Intent](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent) is a request of the system to perform some action, commonly presenting a new activity. The *intent* used in this scenario is called `ACTION_SEND`. Can supply with some data, e.g. string, and present appropriate sharing options for data.

Process for setting up *intent*:
1. Create an intent object and specify the intent, e.g. `ACTION_SEND`.
2. Specify type of additional data being sent with the intent. `'text/plain`, `"image/"*`,  or `"video"/*` are valid options.
3.  Pass any additional data to the intent, such as text, or image to share, by calling the `putExtra()` method. Intent will take two extras: `EXTRA_SUBJECT` and `EXTRA_TEXT`. 
4. Call the `startActivity()` method of context, passing an activity created from the intent.

```kotlin
composable(route = CupcakeScreen.Summary.name) {  
    val context = LocalContext.current  
    OrderSummaryScreen(  
        orderUiState = uiState,  
        onCancelButtonClicked = { cancelOrderAndNavigateToStart(viewModel, navController) },  
        onSendButtonClicked = {subject: String, summary: String ->  
            shareOrder(context, subject, summary)  
        },  
        modifier = Modifier.fillMaxHeight()  
    )  
}
```

```kotlin
private fun shareOrder(context: Context, subject: String, summary: String) {  
    val intent = Intent(Intent.ACTION_SEND).apply {  
        type = "text/plain"  
        putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_SUBJECT, subject)  
        putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_TEXT, summary)  
    }  
  
    context.startActivity(  
        Intent.createChooser(  
            intent,  
            context.getString(R.string.new_cupcake_order)  
        )  
    )  
}
```

## Make the App Bar Respond to Navigation
- The app bar does not automatically respond to navigation. Title doesn't update when the app navigates to a new route, nor does it display the *Up button* before the title when appropriate.

> [!Note] 
> The system back button is provided by the Android operating system and is located at the bottom of the screen.
>![Icon of the system Back button.](https://developer.android.com/static/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-navigation/img/7a4c3a5081adce31.png?authuser=1)
The Up button, on the other hand, is located in your app's `AppBar`.
![Icon of the Up button shown in the AppBar.](https://developer.android.com/static/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-navigation/img/cdd42ef932a23664.png?authuser=1)
Within the context of your app, both the back button and the Up button do the same thing—navigate back to the previous screen

- Starter code includes composable to manage the `Appbar` named `CupcakeAppBar`. Can use the information from the backstack to display the correct title, and show the Up button if appropriate. The `CupcakeAppBar` composable should be aware of the current screen s.t. the title updates appropriately.

1. Add a resource value for each enum case, which corresponds to the title text for each screen.
```kotlin
import androidx.annotation.StringRes

enum class CupcakeScreen(@StringRes val title: Int) {  
    Start(title = R.string.app_name),  
    Flavor(title = R.string.choose_flavor),  
    Pickup(title = R.string.choose_pickup_date),  
    Summary(title = R.string.order_summary)  
}
```

2. Add a parameter called `currentScreen` of type `CupcakeScreen`, and set the title of the `TopAppBar`.
```kotlin
fun CupcakeAppBar(  
    currentScreen: CupcakeScreen,  
    canNavigateBack: Boolean,  
    navigateUp: () -> Unit,  
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier  
) {  
    TopAppBar(  
        title = { Text(stringResource(id = currentScreen.title)) },  
        colors = TopAppBarDefaults.mediumTopAppBarColors(  
            containerColor = MaterialTheme.colorScheme.primaryContainer  
        ),  
			... 
    )  
}
```

The Up button shows if there is a composable on the back stack. If app has no screens on the back stack - `StartOrderScreen` is shown - then Up button should not show. To check, need a reference to the back screen.

1. In the `CupcakeApp` composable, create a variable called `backStackEntry`, and call the `currentBackStackEntryAsState()` method of `navController` using `by` delegate.
2. Convert the current screen's title to a value of `CupcakeScreen`. Create a `val` named `currentScreen` which would be the result of calling `valueOf` class function of `CupcakeScreen`, passing route of destination of `backStackEntry`. Use the elvis operator (`?:`) to provide a default value of `CupcakeScreen.Start.name`.
3. Pass value of `currentScreen` into parameter of `CupcakeAppBar`.
```kotlin
fun CupcakeApp(  
    viewModel: OrderViewModel = viewModel(),  
    navController: NavHostController = rememberNavController()  
) {  
    val backStackEntry by navController.currentBackStackEntryAsState()  
  
    val currentScreen = CupcakeScreen.valueOf(  
        backStackEntry?.destination?.route ?: CupcakeScreen.Start.name  
    )  
  
    Scaffold(  
        topBar = {  
            CupcakeAppBar(  
                currentScreen = currentScreen,  
                canNavigateBack = false,  
                navigateUp = { /* TODO: implement back navigation */ }  
            )  
        }  
    ) {...}
    ...
```

As long as there's a screen behind the current screen on the back stack, the Up button should show. Can use a boolean expression to identify if the Up button should identify.

1. `canNavigateBack`: pass boolean expression checking if `previousBackStackEntry` property of `navController` is not equal to `null`.
2. To navigate back to previous screen, call `navigateUp()` method of `navController`.
```kotlin
val backStackEntry by navController.currentBackStackEntryAsState()  
  
val currentScreen = CupcakeScreen.valueOf(  
    backStackEntry?.destination?.route ?: CupcakeScreen.Start.name  
)

Scaffold(  
    topBar = {  
        CupcakeAppBar(  
            currentScreen = currentScreen,  
            canNavigateBack = navController.previousBackStackEntry != null,  
            navigateUp = { navController.navigateUp() }  
        )  
    }  
) { ... }
```
