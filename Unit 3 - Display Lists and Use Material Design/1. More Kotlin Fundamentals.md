# Generics, Objects and Extensions
## Reusable class with Generics
- *Generic Types* (generics) - Allow a datatype such as class to specify an unknown placeholder data type, that can be used with its properties and methods.
- Syntax:
```kotlin
class [name] <generic data type> (
	//properties
	val prop_name : data_type
)
```
- The data type that the generic type uses is passed as a parameter in angle brackets when instantiating the class.
```kotlin
val instance_name = class_name<data_type>(/*parameters*/)
```
- Example:
```kotlin
class Question<T>(
	val questionText: String,
	val answer: T
	val difficulty: String
)

fun main() {
	val question1 = Question<String> = ("Quoth the raven ___", "nevermore", "medium")
	val question2 = Question<Boolean>("The sky is green. True or False.", false, "easy")
	val question3 = Question<Int>("How many days between full moons>", 28, "hard")
}
```

## Enum Class
```kotlin
enum class Difficulty {
	EASY, MEDIUM, HARD
}

class Question<T>(
	val questionText: String,
	val answer: T
	val difficulty: Difficulty
)

fun main() {
	val question1 = Question<String> = ("Quoth the raven ___", "nevermore", MEDIUM)
	val question2 = Question<Boolean>("The sky is green. True or False.", false, EASY)
	val question3 = Question<Int>("How many days between full moons>", 28, HARD)
}
```

## Use a Data Class
A `data class` is a class which only contains data, and no methods. Synonymous with a struct.

Converting the previous example to a data class:
```kotlin
data class Question<T>(
	val questionText: String,
	val answer: T
	val difficulty: Difficulty
)
```

The following methods are automatically implemented in a data class:
- `equals()`
- `hashCode()`: Used when working with certain collection types.
- `toString()`
- [`componentN()`](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/destructuring-declarations.html#example-returning-two-values-from-a-function)
- `copy()`

> [!Note]
> A data class needs to have at least one parameter in its constructor. All constructor parameters must be marked with `val` or `var`. A data class also cannot be `abstract`, `open`, `sealed`, or `inner`.


## Use a Singleton Object
- Singleton Object: An object that can only have one instance.
- Syntax:
```kotlin
object object_name {
	// class body 1
}
```
- Since only declared once, it does not have a constructor. 
```kotlin
object StudentProgress {
	var total: Int = 10,
	var answered: Int = 3
}

fun main() {
	StudentProgress.answered
}
```

- You can declare a singleton object inside another object using a **companion object**.
- A **companion object** allows accessing singleton object  properties and methods from inside the class. 
- Syntax: `companion object object_name`.
- Example
```kotlin
class Quiz {
	val question1 = Question<String> = ("Quoth the raven ___", "nevermore", Difficulty.MEDIUM)
	val question2 = Question<Boolean>("The sky is green. True or False.", false, Difficulty.EASY)
	val question3 = Question<Int>("How many days between full moons>", 28, Difficulty.HARD)

	companion object StudentProgress {
		var total: Int = 10,
		var answered: Int = 3
	}
}

fun main() {
	println("${Quiz.answered} of ${Quiz.total} answered")
}
```

## Extend Classes with New Properties and Methods
Kotlin allows extending data types, adding properties and methods that can be accessed with dot syntax as if part of that data type. 

### Add an Extension Property
- Syntax:
```kotlin
val type_name.property_name: data_type 
property_getter
```

- Example.
```kotlin
val Quiz.StudentProgress.progressText: String
	get() = "${answered} of ${total} answered"

fun main() {
	println(Quiz.progressText)
}
```

> [!Note]
> Extension properties can't store data, so they must be get-only.

### Add an Extension Function
- Syntax
```kotlin
fun type_name.function_name(parameters) : return_type {
	// function body
}
```
- Example.
```kotlin
fun Quiz.StudentProgress.printProgressBar() {
	repeat(Quiz.answred) { print("▓") }
	repeat(Quiz.total - Quiz.answered) { print("▒") }
	println()
	println(Quiz.progressText)
}
```

Output:
▓▓▓▒▒▒▒▒▒▒
3 of 10 answered.

## Rewrite Extension Function using Interfaces
- Extending a class is not always necessary when you have access to source code. 
- There are also situations where you don't know what the implementation should be, only that a certain method or property should exist. If you need multiple classes to have the same additional properties and methods, perhaps with differing behavior, you can define these properties and methods with an _interface_.
- Syntax
```kotlin
interface InterfaceName {
	// body
}
```
- An *interface* is a contract. A class conforms to an interface is said to extend the interface. Thus, the class must implement all properties and methods specified in the interface. Syntax:
```kotlin
class ClassName: InterfaceName {
	// Class body
}
```

- Example
```kotlin
interface ProgressPrintable {
	val progressText: String
	fun printProgressBar()
}

class Quiz : ProgressPrintable {
	override val progressText: String
		get() = "${answered} of ${total} answered"

	override fun printProgressBar() {
		repeat(Quiz.answred) { print("▓") }
		repeat(Quiz.total - Quiz.answered) { print("▒") }
		println()
		println(Quiz.progressText)
	}
}
```

There are numerous use cases for interfaces to help structure your code and you'll start to see them used frequently in the common units. The following are some examples of interfaces you may encounter as you continue working with Kotlin.

- [Manual dependency injection](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/manual?authuser=1). Create an interface defining all the properties and methods of the dependency. Require the interface as the data type of the dependency (activity, test case, etc.) so that an instance of any class implementing the interface can be used. This allows you to swap out the underlying implementations.
- Mocking for automated tests. Both the mock class and the real class conform to the same interface.
- Accessing the same dependencies in a [Compose Multiplatform](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-jb) app. For example, create an interface that provides a common set of properties and methods for Android and desktop, even if the underlying implementation differs for each platform.
- Several data types in Compose, such as [`Modifier`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/ui/Modifier?authuser=1), are interfaces. This allows you to add new modifiers without needing to access or modify the underlying source code.

## Use Scope Functions to Access Class Properties and Methods
- *Scope Functions* allow to concisely access properties and methods from a class without having to repeatedly access the variable name.
- *Scope Functions* are higher-order functions, allows accessing properties and methods of an object without referring to object name. 
- Example 1.
```kotlin
fun printQuiz() {    
	println(question1.questionText)    
	println(question1.answer)    
	println(question1.difficulty)    
	println()    
	println(question2.questionText)    
	println(question2.answer)    
	println(question2.difficulty)    
	println()    
	println(question3.questionText)    
	println(question3.answer)    
	println(question3.difficulty)    
	println()
}

// IS THE SAME AS
class Quiz {
	// question1-3 defined earlier

	fun printQuiz() {
		question1.let{
			println(question1.questionText)    
			println(question1.answer)    
			println(question1.difficulty)
		}    
		println()
		question2.let {    
			println(question2.questionText)    
			println(question2.answer)    
			println(question2.difficulty)    
		}
		println()
		question3.let {    
			println(question3.questionText)    
			println(question3.answer)    
			println(question3.difficulty)  
		}  
		println()
	}
}
```

- Can call a scope function on a object before it has been assigned to a variable. An example is the `apply()` function extension, can be called on an object using dot notation. Can also return a reference to the object to be stored in a variable.
```kotlin
fun main() {
	Quiz().apply {
		printQuiz()
	}
}
```

The above code demonstrates just two examples, but you're encouraged to bookmark and refer to the [Scope Functions documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/scope-functions.html) as you encounter their usage later in the course.

# Use Collections in Kotlin
- Store a collection of values, usually same data type.
## Arrays in Kotlin
```kotlin
val name = arrayOf<data_type>(element1, ...)
```

```kotlin
val rockPlants: Array<String>
val solarSystem: Array<String>

// Combine both arrays above
val solarSystem = rockPlanets + solarSystem
```

## Lists
- A **List** Ordered, resizeable collection, typically implemented as a resizeable array.
- Can also insert elements between other elements at a specific index.
- `List`: Interface that defines properties and methods related to a read-only ordered collection of items.
- `MutableList`: Extends `List` interface by defining methods to modify a list, such as adding and removing elements.
- A list is defined using the `listOf` function, similar to `arrayOf()`
- List has `.get()` to get an element at a given index.
- `.indexOf()` gets index of an elements first occurrence, else -1.
- Can iterate using:
```kotlin
for (elem in collection_name) {
	// code
}
```

- For an editable list, define list using `mutableListOf(elements)`
- Add element using `.add(val)`, or `.add(idx, val)`.
- Remove element using `.removeAt(idx)` or `.remove(elem)`.
- Check if element exists using `.contains(elem)`.

## Set
- A *set* is a collection that does not have a specific order, and does not allow duplicate values.

> [!Note] 
> A set uses hash codes as array indices. Of course, there can be about 4 billion different hash codes, so a `Set` isn't just one giant array. Instead, you can think of a `Set` as an array of lists.
> 
> ![a44f3d05140a19bd.png](https://developer.android.com/static/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-collections/img/a44f3d05140a19bd.png?authuser=1)
>
> The outer array—the numbers outlined in blue on the left—each correspond to a range (also known as a bucket) of possible hash codes. Each inner list—shaded in green on the right—represents the individual items in the set. Since hash collisions are relatively uncommon, even when the potential indices are limited, the inner lists at each array index will only have one or two items each, unless tens or hundreds of thousands of elements are added.
- Like lists, there is `Set` and `MutableSet`.
- Sets are faster than list/arrays in searching, however they take more memory.
- Create a mutable set using `mutableSetOf(elements)`.
- Available methods include `.add()`, `.size`, `.remove(elem)` and `.contains(elem)`.

## Map Collection
- A `Map` is the same as a `dict` in python. Use a key to refer to a value.
- Declared using `mapOf<key_type, value_type>(key1 to value1, key2 to value2, ...)` or `mutableMapOf<...>(...)`

# Higher-Order Functions with Collections
## `forEach()` and String Templates with Lambda
- The `forEach()` function executes the function passed as a parameter for each item in the collection.
```kotlin
forEach(action: (T) -> Unit)
```

- Example
```kotlin
class Cookie (
	val name: String,
    val softBaked: Boolean,
    val hasFilling: Boolean,
    val price: Double
)

val cookies = listOf(
    Cookie(
        name = "Chocolate Chip",
        softBaked = false,
        hasFilling = false,
        price = 1.69
    ),
    ...
)


fun main() {
    cookies.forEach {
        println("Menu item: ${it.name}")
    }
}
```


## `map()` Function
- The `map()` lets you transform a collection into a new collection with the same number of elements.
- Using the previous example:
```kotlin
val fullMenu = cookies.map {
	"${it.name} - $${it.price}"
}
```

## `filter()` Function
- The `filter()` function creates a subset of a collection given some condition.
- Using the previous example:
```kotlin
val softBakedMenu = cookies.filter {
	it.softBaked
}
softBakedMenu.forEach {
	println("${it.name} - $${it.price}")
}
```

## `groupBy` Function
- The `groupBy()` function can be used to turn a list into a map, based on a function. Each unique return value of the function becomes a key in the resulting map.
- Example.
```kotlin
val nums: List<Int> = listOf(8, 6, 7, 5, 3, 0, 9)
val odd: Map<Int, List<Int>> = nums.groupBy {
	it % 2
}

```
- Using the previous example.
```kotlin
val softBakedMenu = cookies.groupBy {it.softBaked}

val softBakedMenu = groupedMenu[true] ?: listOf()
val crunchyMenu = groupedMenu[false] ?: listOf()
```
- **NOTE**: If only need to split a list into 2, alternative is [`partition()`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.collections/partition.html) function.

## `fold()` function
- The `fold()` function is used to generate a single value from a collection.
- `fold(initial_val: T, fun: (T, V) -> (T))`
- Example:
```kotlin
val totalPrice = cookies.fold(0.0) { total, cookie ->
	total + cookie.price
}
println("Total price: $${totalPrice}")
```
- **NOTE:** `fold()` also known as `reduce()`.
- **NOTE:** There is also a `sum()` and higher-order `sum()` function.

## `sortedBy()` function
- Used the sort the values in a collection given a property.
- Example:
```kotlin
val alphabeticalMenu = cookies.sortedBy {
	it.name
}
```
- **NOTE**: If the data type has a natural sort order, use the `sort()` function.
