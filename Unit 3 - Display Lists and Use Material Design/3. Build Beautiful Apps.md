# Material Theming with Jetpack Compose
## Add Colour
The android system represents colours in a 8 digit hex.
![This shows the hexadecimal numbers that is used to create colors.](https://developer.android.com/static/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-material-theming/img/e0349c33dd6fbafe.png?authuser=1)

The alpha value represents the transparency of the colour, where #00 is 0% opacity (fully transparent), and # FF is 100% opacity (opaque). If the alpha value is not included, the colour is assumed as opaque.

### Use Material Theme Builder to Create Colour Scheme
1. Go to the [Material Theme Builder](https://m3.material.io/theme-builder#/custom).
2. On the left pane, select the colour to adjust, and select the colour using Hex or using the colour picker. After selection, the app preview will show the adjusted colour scheme.
3. Some of the colour description uses:
	- **Primary**: Key components across UI.
	- **Secondary**: Less prominent components in UI.
	- **Tertiary**: Contrasting accents; used to balance primary and secondary colours; bring heightened attention to an element. Example: input field.
	- The **on** colour elements appear **on top** of other colours in the palette; primarily applied to text, iconography, and strokes. 
	- **onSurface** colour appears atop the **surface** colour
	- **onPrimary** appears atop the **primary** colour.
### Add Colour Palette to Theme
1. Open the `Color.kt` file and replace the contents with the code from the new colour scheme.
2. Open the `Theme.kt` file and replace the contents with the code from the new theme.
3. Rebuild the app

> [!Note]
> `WolfTheme()` has a `colorScheme val` which uses a `when`:
> - If `dynamicColor == True`: Checks if device is in `darkTheme` or not.
> 	- If in dark theme, `colorScheme` set to `dynamicDarkColorScheme`
> 	- If not in dark theme, `colorScheme` set to `dynamicLightColorScheme`.
> - If `!dynamicColor`:
> 	- If app set to `darkTheme`, `colorScheme` set to `DarkColors`
> 	- If neither true, `colorScheme` set to `LightColors`.

### Colour Mapping
- Material components automatically mapped to colour slots. 
- Other key components across the UI like Floating Action Buttons also default to the Primary Colour. 
- Thus, don't need to explicitly assign colour to components... instead automatically mapped to colour slot when colour theme set in app. Can be overridden by setting a colour in the code. Read more [here](https://m3.material.io/styles/color/the-color-system/color-roles).

### Dimens File
- Similar to the use for `strings.xml`,  the `dimens.xml` is used to track padding, so don't need to hard code values; and values stored in a single place.
- Stored in app->res->values->dimens.xml
```xml
<resources>
	<dimen name="padding_small">8dp</dimen>
	<dimen name="padding_medium">16dp</dimen>
	<dimen name="image_size">64dp</dimen>
</resources>
```

The format to add a value from `dimens.xml`:
```kotlin
dimensionResource(id=R.id.<dimension_name>)
```
