# Add a list to your app
- To keep the code organized, use a data class to store the strings and images (stored in model). Load the data using a Datasource class (stored in data). Both classes are stored in different folders for organization. 
- The `Card {}` compose is used to display stuff in a card like format (a round rectangular box)![4f657540712a069f.png](https://developer.android.com/static/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-training-add-scrollable-list/img/4f657540712a069f.png?authuser=1)
- To load text outside of the realm of a compose function, use: `LocalContext.current.getString(R.id)`
- The `LazyColumn() {items()}` compose is used to repeat loading something a given number of times in a column configuration.
- Alternatives to `LazyColumn()` for a grid like structure include `LazyVerticalGrid()` and `LazyHorizontalGrid()`.
- The current layout directions is used to configure the padding. To do that:
```kotlin
@Composable  
fun AffirmationsApp() {  
    val layoutDirection = LocalLayoutDirection.current  
    Surface (  
        modifier = Modifier  
            .fillMaxSize()  
            .statusBarsPadding()  
            .padding (  
                start = WindowInsets.safeDrawing.asPaddingValues()  
                    .calculateStartPadding(layoutDirection),  
                end = WindowInsets.safeDrawing.asPaddingValues()  
                    .calculateEndPadding(layoutDirection)  
            )  
    ) {  
        AffirmationList(  
            affirmationList = Datasource().loadAffirmations()  
        )  
    }  
}
```

# Change the App Icon
That's why the Android platform introduced support for **adaptive icons** (as of API level 26). By implementing an adaptive icon for your app, your app is able to accommodate a large range of devices by tailoring the launcher icon based on a device's display.

This codelab provides you with image source files for the **Affirmations** app launcher icon. You will use a tool in Android Studio, called **Image Asset Studio**, to generate different versions of the launcher icons. Afterwards, you can take what you learned and apply it to app icons for other apps!

## Launcher Icons
- The icons are stored under app->build->src->main->res->drawable->mipmap-xxxx. A regular and circular icon are both provided.
- The list of density qualifiers for the icons:
	- `mdpi` - resources for medium-density screens (~160 dpi)
	- `hdpi` - resources for high-density screens (~240 dpi)
	- `xhdpi` - resources for extra-high-density screens (~320 dpi)
	- `xxhdpi` - resources for extra-extra-high-density screens (~480 dpi)
	- `xxxhdpi` - resources for extra-extra-extra-high-density screens (~640 dpi)
	- `nodpi` - resources that are not meant to be scaled, regardless of the screen's pixel density
	- `anydpi` - resources that scale to any density
## Adaptive Icons
- Adaptive icons are icons with that has 2 layers, foreground and background layer. This allows for more flexibility and interesting visual effects.
- Adaptive icons are stored in an xml:
```xml
<adaptive-icon xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">  
    <background android:drawable="@drawable/ic_launcher_background"/>  
    <foreground android:drawable="@drawable/ic_launcher_foreground"/>  
    <monochrome android:drawable="@drawable/ic_launcher_foreground" />  
</adaptive-icon>
```
- The background and foreground layers are stored in xml files as well. They are vector drawable files, therefore no fixed size in pixels.
- Difference between bitmap and vector drawable:
	- Bitmap image only understands the colour information at each pixel. Vector graphic knows how to draw the shapes that define an image. Instructions composed of set of points, lines, curves, and colour information. 
	- Vector graphic can be scaled for any canvas size, for any screen density without losing quality.
	- Tradeoffs: Can't be a photograph icon. Would be more efficient as bitmap asset instead then.
